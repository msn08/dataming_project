### description by professor: "you have to analyze the difficulty of your friends text. If it's a1,a2,b1,b2 and so on"

Makes me think of the article ["Donald trump speaks at fourth grade level"](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-fire-and-fury-smart-genius-obama-774169)

## TODO
- Read academic paper [The Readability and Simplicity of Donald Trumpâ€™s Language](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1478929917706844?journalCode=pswa)
- Find formula to jugde readability
- Find classification of European thing (a1,a2,b1,b2,c1,c2)
