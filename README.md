### description by professor: "you have to analyze the difficulty of your friends text. If it's a1,a2,b1,b2 and so on"

Makes me think of the article ["Donald trump speaks at fourth grade level"](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-fire-and-fury-smart-genius-obama-774169)

- Find formula to jugde readability
  - Flesch–Kincaid formula 
  - Gunning-Fog Index
  - SMOG
- Find classification of the CEFR (a1,a2,b1,b2,c1,c2)
  - https://www.englishprofile.org/american-english
